# Android-Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Android Malware Detection Using Machine Learning Project with Source Code
### Abstract : 
Android is the world's most popular and widely used operating system for mobile smartphones today. One
of the reasons for this popularity is the free third-party applications that are downloaded and installed and
provide various types of benefits to the user. Unfortunately, this flexibility of installing any application
created by third parties has also led to an endless stream of constantly evolving malware applications that
are intended to cause harm to the user in many ways.
In this project, different approaches for tackling the problem of Android malware detection are presented
and demonstrated. The data analytics of a real-time detection system is developed. The detection system
can be used to scan through installed applications to identify potentially harmful ones so that they can be
uninstalled. This is achieved through machine learning models.
Most Important Machine Learning algorithms are applied on the andorid mapplication datasets and then we get to predict as detect android application contains malwares or no
